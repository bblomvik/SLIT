If you would like to contribute to this project by modifying/adding to the program code or various creative assets, feel free to follow the standard Github workflow:
YOUTUBE TUTORIAL: (COMING SOON)

1. Fork the project.
2. Clone your fork to your computer.
3. Create a branch for your new feature.
4. Make your changes.
    * Avoid making changes to more files than necessary for your feature (i.e. refrain from combining your "real" pull request with incidental bug fixes). This will simplify the merging process and make your changes clearer.
    * Very much avoid making changes to the Unity-specific files, like the scene and the project settings unless absolutely necessary. Changes here are very likely to cause difficult to merge conflicts. Work in code as much as possible. (We will be trying to change the UI to be more code-driven in the future.) Making changes to prefabs should generally be safe -- but create a copy of the main scene and work there instead (then delete your copy of the scene before committing).
5. Commit your changes and push your branch to your fork.
    * You may want to pull in the lastest project games from the upstream master before pushing your own changes, to ensure that you are up to date.
6. Make a "Pull Request" from your branch here on Github.
    * Include screenshots demonstrating your change if applicable.
